# hello-world

Hello everybody!

My name is Emils, and I am the past and present of my self, and I'm looking forward to become my future. I'll be one of the greatest if not THE best coders out there and I'll make sure that I will get enough of sleep next time I try to figure out what to write when describing my self.

 I also like doggos, but I sure as hell don't mind los catos neither.
